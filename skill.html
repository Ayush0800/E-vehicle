    <h2>What is an Electric Vehicle (EV)?</h2>
    <br>
    
    
    <p>An electric vehicle (EV) is a type of vehicle that is powered by one or more electric motors, using electricity stored in rechargeable batteries or another energy storage device. Unlike traditional vehicles that rely on internal combustion engines fueled by gasoline or diesel, electric vehicles operate entirely or partially on electric power. They offer an environmentally friendly alternative to conventional vehicles, producing zero tailpipe emissions during operation, which contributes to reducing air pollution and mitigating climate change. Electric vehicles come in various forms, including battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), each utilizing different combinations of electric and conventional power sources.</p>
